Imager::Font::W32 provides font support to Imager via the Win32 GDI
API functions..

It requires Win32 header files and libraries to be available.

This is currently shipped as part of Imager, but in the future it will
be removed from Imager, if your module or application requires Win32
font support support then add Imager::Font::W32 as a prerequisite.
